**Should I know something before posting?**
Of course, read the #rules and pay attention to the channel descriptions of the channels you want to post in, there's often local rules in there

**Where can I ask questions?**
We have channels for a lot of popular engines (#unity-dev #unreal-dev #godot-dev #gms-dev). If your engine/toolkit is not represented you can post in #other-engines.

**I'm developing a custom engine, is there a ~~#witchcraft-dev~~ place to seek help with that?**
Yes, #misc-dev is often used by people doing custom engines as well as low level development in general.

**I need help with art or music**
We have #2d-art #3d-art #audio-chat  as well as others, look through the creative arts category!

**Design? Career?**
Yes, #game-design-theory, #career-advice 

**Where's the general chat?**
We have two, #gamedev-chat is for stuff that doesn't fall under any other channel / getting advice, #social is for hanging out and non-serious topics

**I want to hire someone / be hired / join a team / find team members**
Look into the jobs section just above the voice channels, **make sure to read the pinned post**

**I want to share my game / game-dev related work in progress**
#show-off-your-work exists for sharing snippets, for completed games we have... #completed-games

**How do I post pictures / get my links embeded / join voice chat?**
